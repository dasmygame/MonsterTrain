## Project Idea
Feeling inspired by the coming Christmas season (and a little bit of Polar Express), our project is a winter-themed Monster truck-train hybrid: the Monster Train. The Monster Train is a remote controller vehicle that can be piloted over bluetooth user the user's cell phone and has a handful of fun features including:
<br>
<br>~ Collision detection
<br>~ LED movement indicator
<br>~ LED smokestack effect
<br>~ Train sound effects
<br>~ Fun, themed LCD display
<br>
<br>We designed and manufactured a custom housing designed to look like a train engine and a vehicle base including suspension. <br>

## Design of Vehicle Base and Enclosure
<br>- The Train design was split into 2 parts, the drive train and the shell top. Both were designed from scratch in TinkerCad and 3D Printed using PLA.
### Drive Train:
<br>- The drive train of the train features 6 wheel drive with the 2 motors attached to the center wheels, making the MonsterTrain center-wheel drive.
<br>- 6 Fenders above each wheel to provide reinforcement from drastic wheel differential suspension changes.
<br>- Suspension was designed and made using a hinge, a spring, and a spring slot holder. This gives feedback and tension for grip when going up elevated surfaces or over obstacles.
<br>- Suspension is loose on non-drive wheels and very tight on center-drive wheel so the vehicle and go in reverse.
<br>- Turning is supported by reverse motion in wheel opposite to turning direction.
