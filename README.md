## Project Idea
Feeling inspired by the coming Christmas season (and a little bit of Polar Express), our project is a winter-themed Monster truck-train hybrid: the Monster Train. The Monster Train is a remote controller vehicle that can be piloted over bluetooth user the user's cell phone and has a handful of fun features including:
~ Collision detection
~ LED movement indicator
~ LED smokestack effect
~ Train sound effects
~ Fun, themed LCD display
We designed and manufactured a custom housing designed to look like a train engine and a vehicle base including suspension.
